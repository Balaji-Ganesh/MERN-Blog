- ### Bug fixes

  - Notifying with a proper message to the user, for every respondable action peformed.
  - After clicked on "Update Account Details", they get updated, but UI doesn't resemble that. For checking this, try repeating the action, and refer to the console for the error.
  - The UI can be improved.

- profile pictures are prefixed with "profile", and blog posts, with no additional prefix (in `./assets/images/`)
  Also check the CLIENT's `notes.md`.
