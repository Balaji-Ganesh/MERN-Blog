## Note

---

- **This work is still in progress, post links, login, register and few won't work.**
- Rectangles at left and right side of topbar -- kept for understanding. They can be disabled from CSS (Look for the comment of removal in `topbar.css`)
- `aboutUs` is not developed, will just get a blank page if tried to access.
- For checking the functionality of user -login status, toggle the `userLoginStatus` in `App.js` and `Topbar.jsx`

## Bugs

---

- In the login and register pages, getting the same background, even though the baackground-url's are different.
